installing oceanoptics usb2000+ on a computer:

A: installing spectrometer software:
1. Install omnidriver + spam (Y:\Nate\Wayne\Ocean Optics OMNI\100115_1003) using password: Etm4QBn7gd
2. Plug in spectrometer, make sure it installs correctly (should see ocean optics spectrometer in the device manager)
3. Install seabreeze http://oceanoptics.com/product/seabreeze/ ***make sure x64 or 32 is correct version
4. Install lib-usbwin32:
     http://sourceforge.net/projects/libusb-win32/files/libusb-win32-releases/1.2.6.0/
5. Then run inf-wizard.exe, create a .inf for the spectrometer and install it.
6. Run install-filter-win.exe (in libusb-win32-bin-1.2.6.0\bin\x86 or libusb-win32-bin-1.2.6.0\bin\amd64, if the computer is 32 or 64 bit, respectively)
7. Unplug the spectrometer and plug it back in.


B: installing python and the code to take the measurements:
1. Download and install pythonxy (https://code.google.com/p/pythonxy/)
2. Open a command prompt (start-> type "cmd")
type the following commands to install python packages:
easy_install easygui
easy_install pyusb
easy_install ctypes
easy_install openpyxl

easy_install cython (don't think you actually need this one, you can try skipping it)

3. Download the installer for python-seabreeze from 
https://github.com/ap--/python-seabreeze/releases
Make sure you download the release for the correct version of python (i.e. cp27 is for python 2.7) and processor architecture.

install python-seabreeze to interface with USB2000+ and python:
in cmd console:

pip install xxxxx.whl

C: Final steps
1. type 'python Y:/Nate/OES/installOESsoftware.py' or double click that file, it will copy all of the required files to the hard drive.
2. change the name of the 'MC0X' to reflect the name of the current tool.
3. Set up a task in windows task scheduler to run the file 'C:/OESdata/auto backup files, read schedule and start measurements.py' every day at 5 am.
This will back up the data on the shared drive, check the schedule to see if any runs are happening today, and monitor 
the process and automatically collect data when the process starts.

 

notes:
after plugging in spectrometer, you may need to right click the device in device manager, choose 'update driver', and find the ocean optics folder in program files.

if having problems with python compiling, here is a fix to try:

download and install visual studio (https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/free-developer-offers-vs.aspx)
	install python seabreeze package: download from https://github.com/ap--/python-seabreeze
	then fix vcvarsall.bat problem as explained here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2817869/error-unable-to-find-vcvarsall-bat
	(SET VS90COMNTOOLS=%VS120COMNTOOLS% for VisualStudio 2013)
