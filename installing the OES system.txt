installing oceanoptics usb2000+ on a computer:

short version:

install omnidriver + spam (Y:\Nate\Wayne\Ocean Optics OMNI\100115_1003) using password: Etm4QBn7gd
plug in spectrometer, make sure it installs correctly


easy_install easygui
easy_install ctypes
easy_install cython
pyro
py4j


if can't get to run with cython
easy_install pyusb
install seabreeze http://oceanoptics.com/product/seabreeze/ ***make sure x64 or 32 is correct version
after plugging in spectrometer, you may need to right click the device in device manager, choose 'update driver', and find the ocean optics folder in program files.
install lib-usbwin32
http://sourceforge.net/projects/libusb-win32/files/libusb-win32-releases/1.2.6.0/
then when the spectrometer is installed (need to choose oceanoptics folder in program files for device driver), install a filter using lib-usbwin32
Y:\Nate\new MC02 OES program\libusb-win32-bin-1.2.6.0\bin\amd64
probably also need to use inf-wizard to install driver
may need to copy .dll and .sys files to windows/system32 by hand if getting no backend available error


install python-seabreeze to interface with USB2000+ and python:
in cmd console:

pip install xxxxx.whl

	download and install visual studio (https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/free-developer-offers-vs.aspx)
